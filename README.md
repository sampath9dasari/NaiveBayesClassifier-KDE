# Naive Bayes Classifier with Kernel Density Estimation from scratch

In this work, we will implement a Naive Bayes Classifier that perform density estimation using Parzen windows.

We will implement multiple kernels:
* Hypercube
* Radial

We will also implement 2 versions of model:
* Single bandwidth for a single-class/multi-class prediction problem.
* Class-specific multi bandwidths for a multi-class prediction problem. 

> At the end We will compare the results of different implementations of model with the ***sklearn - Gaussian Naive Bayes model***.
